        <h2 id="post1">First Impressions of Seoul</h2>

        <p>Arriving in <span class="highlight">Seoul</span> was like stepping into the future. The subway system is incredibly quiet and efficient. My first stop was <strong>Gyeongbokgung Palace</strong>, where I watched the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony. The contrast between the silent, colorful palace and the busy glass skyscrapers of Gwanghwamun is something you have to see to believe.</p>

        <h2 id="post2">N Seoul Tower Views</h2>
        <h6 class="post-date">Posted on January 27, 2026</h6>
        
        <p>Today I hiked up Namsan Mountain to reach the <strong>N Seoul Tower</strong>. Even though it was a bit chilly, the panoramic view of the Han River winding through the city was worth it. I saw thousands of "love locks" attached to the fences. Afterward, I headed down to <em>Itaewon</em> for dinner, which is a great place to find a mix of international and traditional Korean food.</p>
