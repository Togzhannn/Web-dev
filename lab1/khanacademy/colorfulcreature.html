        <p> <strong>Cats</strong> <em></em> are awesome because they are affectionate, independent, and low-maintenance companions that <em>bring joy through their playful,</em> often humorous antics and soothing purrs. Their cleanliness, intelligence, and ability to thrive in apartments make them ideal pets, while their grooming habits and instinctual, quiet nature offer a<em> calming, stress-reducing presence.</em></p>
